## Sidebar
The sidebar provides the interface for navigating through the notes. It currently stores the files and folders for rendering the file tree.

We use the recursive rendering of folders and subfolders to display the file tree.

### Features to be made
- CRUD files and folders.
- Search functionality.
- Drag and drop functionality.
- Sorting functionality.

##### Visual aspects
- Better color scheme.
- Vertical lines to show hierarchy left of file and folders.
